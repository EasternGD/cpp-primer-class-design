Business)China's escalating crackdown on the country's once-mighty technology
sector shows no signs of abating, leaving investors to wonder: Where does the
market rout end?

What's happening: China passed sweeping new rules about the collection and use
of personal data on Friday, just days after it proposed major changes to curb
anti-competitive behavior by big internet firms. Beijing says the potential
mishandling of data poses risks to national security as regulators apply
pressure to companies that list overseas.
"Once the privacy law comes into effect in November ... China's regulatory
regime for tech will be one of the strictest of any major economy," said Julian
Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics. "That's a
remarkable shift from just a year or so ago when the opposite was true. " The
news sent Hong Kong's Hang Seng down 1.8% as the index officially entered a
bear market, having plunged 20% from its recent peak.

The impact of Beijing's steady tightening of the screws on the country's tech
giants is even more apparent when examining individual companies.  It's been
more than nine months since Alibaba (BABA) affiliate Ant Group suspended its
public offering following a dust-up between China's regulators and co-founder
Jack Ma. Yet the company's shares continue to get crushed.
Alibaba's stock in Hong Kong, which shed 2.6% on Friday, has plummeted 32% year-to-date, erasing more than $180 billion in market value.
Shares in New York tell a similar story, having lost 31% this year.
JD.com (JD), another Chinese e-commerce company, saw its stock drop 2% in Hong Kong on Friday. It's down 29% in 2021.
Consensus is growing that more pain is to come. Pritchard notes "legitimate
concerns about the underlying motivations behind the abrupt crackdown and
whether it forebodes broader efforts to rein in the private sector and shore up
the position of the state." Meanwhile, the companies caught in the crossfire
have made clear they think the campaign by regulators will only intensify.
Tencent (TCEHY), the Chinese gaming and social media giant, said Wednesday that that "new regulations should be coming" in the near future.
"The regulators are very focused on identifying and rectifying industry
misbehavior and also efficient regulations," Martin Lau, Tencent's president,
told analysts during a conference call. "They emphasize compliance, social
responsibility as well as fair and proper behavior." Lau noted that the company
would try to steer clear of trouble.
"There will be short-term uncertainties and there are a lot of new regulations
that will be coming, but we are pretty confident that we can be compliant," he
said.  But that didn't stop the company's shares from losing 9.5% this week.
Year-to-date, they're down 25%.
US regulators take another stab at breaking up Facebook
The Federal Trade Commission isn't backing away from its bid to break up Facebook (FB).
The latest: Regulators filed an amended complaint in federal court on Thursday
alleging the tech giant has monopolized social media and harmed competition, my
CNN Business colleague Brian Fung reports.  FTC files fresh antitrust complaint
seeking to break up Facebook
FTC files fresh antitrust complaint seeking to break up Facebook
The new complaint comes nearly two months after a federal judge tossed out the
original, arguing that the FTC had not provided sufficient evidence that
Facebook holds a monopoly in social media.  The fresh version — which is about
50% longer — will let regulators have another go. It claims that Facebook broke
the law by engaging in anticompetitive acquisitions, most notably of Instagram
and WhatsApp, and denied third-party apps access to Facebook's platform.
In a statement, Facebook called the suit "meritless." Its deadline to respond in court is in early October.
"There was no valid claim that Facebook was a monopolist — and that has not
changed," the company said. "Our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were
reviewed and cleared many years ago, and our platform policies were lawful."
Step back: The stakes are high. The suit marks one of the largest legal
challenges ever to Facebook's social media empire at a time when it faces
mounting scrutiny in the United States and abroad. If successful, it could
force Facebook to spin off Instagram or WhatsApp.
Leading the charge is FTC Chair Lina Khan, a vocal critic of the tech industry
who helped author a groundbreaking congressional report last year that found
that Facebook, along with Amazon, Apple and Google, have abused dominant market
positions to preserve their power. On Thursday, the FTC announced that Khan
would not recuse herself from the Facebook case, despite calls from the company
for her to do so.  Investor insight: Investors aren't panicking. Shares of the
company are up 30% so far this year. But increased regulation remains one of
the top risks to Facebook's business.
Tesla is building a humanoid robot
What's the answer to "boring, repetitive and dangerous" work? Build a humanoid robot, according to Elon Musk.
The Tesla (TSLA) CEO said Thursday that the company is working on a prototype that will likely arrive next year, my CNN Business colleague Matt McFarland reports.
Musk did not say if it would be sold or for how much. The robot will have a screen positioned where a human face would be to display "useful information."
Human-like robots have long been a fascination in pop culture. But creating a
device that can perform human tasks has proven incredibly difficult. Artificial
intelligence has improved rapidly, but remains far behind the general abilities
of even a human toddler. Robotics applications have been restricted to basic
tasks in simple environments, such as carrying goods in a factory, or
autonomously vacuuming a home.  Watch this space: Musk said the robot would
have a "profound" impact on the economy. He said physical work would ultimately
be a choice, and a universal basic income would be needed.
Think that sounds like the stuff of scary science fiction? Musk disagrees (though I'd love to check in with the company's roughly 71,000 employees).
"We hope this does not feature in a dystopian sci-fi movie," he said.
